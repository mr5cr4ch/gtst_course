Linux

What is Linux
● Linux is a kernel.
WHAT is kernel?
● Kernel is a
code/program that used
to meet your Software
and Hardware. And
allocate some
resources.
History of Linux
● In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken
Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first
version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer,
which was chosen mainly because of
Thompson's familiarity with the system from his
hobby work on it
● BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE
● Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS”
Created the Linux kernel. And posted it online
to make it open-source.
Cont…
● Richard Stallman announced the GNU Linux
project in 1983 and cofounded the Free
Software Foundation in 1985.
● GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX
OS, But it was just software replacement not full
os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .
● So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
● The GNU Linux project was started to create a
Unix-like operating system created with source
code that could be copied, modified, and
redistributed
What is Shell?
● Users communicate with the
kernel by the shell.
● The Shell is a Command Line
Interpreter. It translates
commands entered by the user
and converts them into a
language that is understood by
the Kernel.
Types of shells
● Based on their features there are money shells.
○ SH
○ BASH
○ ZSH
○ FISH
> They differ in Colouring,Piping,command compilation,
some kind of features.
- TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL “echo $SHELL”
sh
BASH
ZSH
fish
What is OS- Operating system??
● We have said UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS but what is OS.
OS is “operating system”, which means the main software
part of computer that helps to work on.
● It contains:
○ Kernel
○ Softwares
○ Desktop environment
○ File extensions
○ Window manager
Kernel
Software
Desktop Environment 
Types of desktop environment on linux
A) mate
Types of desktop environment on linux
B) gnome
- Have beautiful animations, while opening,closing files
Types of desktop environment on linux
C) KDE plasma
Types of desktop environment on linux
D) XFCE
Which Desktop environment is best?
>> Speed depends on:
● Animations
● High Graphics
● Quality
>? Do You have slow pc…
Window manager
i3-window-manage
Why Linux?
● FAST
No high spec computer/device
needed
Why Linux?
● Most used
● 47% of professional developers use Linux-based
operating systems.
● Linux powers 39.2% of websites whose operating
system is known.
● Linux powers 85% of smartphones. (Hayden James)
● Linux, the third most popular desktop OS, has a
market share of 2.09%.
● The Linux market size worldwide will reach $15.64
billion by 2027.
● The world’s top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on
Linux.
● 96.3% of the top one million web servers are running
Linux.
● Today, there are over 600 active Linux distros
Why Linux?
● Most hacking tools
Why Linux?
● Most Secured!
Linux distributions/distro
● Distro is Modified Linux Kernels,type of operating systems with different:
So many distros…
● Debian
○ Kali linux
○ Ubuntu
○ Parrot
● Arch
○ Black
arch
○ Garuda
● Fedora
● Red Hat
● Gentoo
● Android
Which is best for hackers?
● Kali linux
● Parrot Os
● Garuda
● Black Arch
● …
Kali linux
Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for
digital forensics and penetration testing. It is maintained and
funded by Offensive Security.
Desktop Env: xfce
Package manager: apt
Shell: zsh
Parrot Os
Parrot OS is a Linux distribution based on Debian with a focus on
security, privacy, and development.
- Desktop Env: mate
- Package manager: apt
- shell: bash
Garuda
Garuda Linux is a Linux distribution based on the Arch Linux operating
system.
- Desktop Env: KDE plasma
- Package Manager: pacman
- shell: fish
Do windows have distros?
● Windows is not open-source so
peoples won’t use / edit it, so there
won’t be other kind.
● It just give updates and adds some
feature on it.
So… How can we use it?
A) Main OS/ Main-boot
So… How can we use it?
B) DualBoot / 2in1
So… How can we use it?
C) Live boot
So… How can we use it?
D) Cloud terminals
URL: https://www.webminal.org
So… How can we use it?
E) Virtual Machine
Cont…
● Computers have a Technology called
“VIRTUALIZATION”. This is the
method how it allocate our using
memory to the virtual machines/ VM’s
● This is a method to use windows and
linux together.
● Softwares that gives you This ability:
○ HyberV
○ QEMU
○ Virtual Box - Oracle
○ VMware
○ …
You have to check some systems
1. Open task manager
2. Goto performance
3. Open CPU
● If it is disables, you have
to enable in BIOS
settings(check youtube)
● If is is enabled we are
good to go.
So… How can we use it?
F) WSL v2 / Windows Subsystem for Linux
Cont…
You can simply install them from Microsoft Store
So… How can we use it?
G) Termux - Android
For running some codes
And doing simple things!
Assignment for next session
● Based on your computer Performance choose one
method from the 6 methods (except termux) and
setup it for next time.
● Resource: there are many youtube videos check
them.
And just do this no need to do other thing
