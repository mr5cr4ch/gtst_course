Package installation on linux
● ON linux to install softwares you use
package managers.
○ Ex: apt,pacman,pkg,...
● We will use debian package manager.
● On debian the package manager i called
‘APT’ also there is called ‘dpkg’
● Package managers are a free-software
user interface that work with an online
server to handle the installation and
removal of software on Debian, and
Debian-based Linux distributions.
The repository
This is the site/ server kali use to
upload the packages
Advanced package tool / apt /
● Apt is a free-software user interface that work with an
online server to handle the installation and removal of
software on Debian, and Debian-based Linux
distributions.used for online and offline purpose.
● The old ‘apt’ used as ‘apt-get’
● Syntax
○ sudo apt update
○ sudo apt search <softwarename>
○ sudo apt install <softwarename>
○ sudo apt remove <softwarename>
○ sudo apt upgrade
○ sudo apt purge <softwarename>
Package dependencies
● A software can be built based on another program
called ‘modules’
● SO, a program to work properly, the dependencies have
to be installed successfully.
● Those package managers install the
software+dependencies.
example:
Dpkg / Debian package manager /
● Dpkg is an offline package managing
program.
● Packages on debian have an extension
“.deb”
● Syntax
○ sudo dpkg -i <packagename>
○ sudo dpkg -r <packagename>
○ sudo dpkg -P <packagename>
